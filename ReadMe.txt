Implement a project in Java, php or python to perform following functions
-Read files in 'data' directory 
-Read data into memory and filter duplicate records
-Merge data from both files after eliminating duplicates into a new file called 'temp.csv' into 'temp' directory
-Read data from 'temp.csv' and implement average based on starting alphabet of the country and write data in to new file called 'output.csv' in 'output' directory 
-Example: Output should have only one record for all countries that start with a and with values as average of the data. (Watch out for null values)
-Use seperation of concern and create classes for each major component, Ex: One for all file reading and writing, one for calculations e.t.c.
-Do not use any external libraries, read and write files using traditional way 
-Use OOPS concepts when and where you see fit
-Document code adequately 
-Provide brief description of the implemented code and approch
-Create git repository in github and commit your code to the repository
